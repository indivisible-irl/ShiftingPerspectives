What it does
------------

This plugin creates, constantly moves and resizes a world border in your Minecraft world.

Your players won't be allowed to get too comfortable in one spot and will be forced to the surface to flee the oncoming nothingness.

Designed with pvp type servers in mind but creative admins can likely find uses for it on standard servers. Such as opening up a slowly changing landscape on a low end server that couln't handle an unlimited world.
